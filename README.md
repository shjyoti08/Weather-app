Setting Up the Project ðŸš€:

I  have created project using vite and react 
npm create vite@latest 
Next i have used framework react and variant  javascript combination 
Next install - npm install
Next run the app - npm run dev 

 Styling the App ðŸŽ¨:

To make our weather app visually appealing, we'll apply CSS styling. We'll use a combination of CSS frameworks and custom styling to create an attractive and user-friendly interface.
I have used tailwind css library to style my app 
Install this command : npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
Then install : npx tailwindcss init -p  
Next in tailwind.config.js  file we have to add https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite , file configuration 

ðŸ’» Creating the UI Components ðŸ’»
Next, we'll design and create the UI components for our weather app. We'll build a form for users to enter the desired location and display weather information. We'll also create components to handle loading and error states

  Fetching Weather Data : 

I have used axios library to api calling asynchronously   
I have used try and catch method to handle api calling 


ðŸŒ¦ Fetching Weather Data ðŸŒ¦
In this step, I have  integrated a weather API to fetch real-time weather data based on the user's location input. We'll explore different APIs and select one that suits our needs. We'll then implement the logic to fetch the weather data from the API. For that i have used public api https://rapidapi.com/visual-crossing-corporation-visual-crossing-corporation-default/api/visual-crossing-weather/ i have created account to access api after i got rapid key to access the api data i have integrated in that api call so i can access the api data with that key it is successfully integrated .

ðŸ“Š Displaying Weather Information ðŸ“Š
Once we have the weather data, we'll parse and extract the necessary information. We'll then update the UI components to display the relevant weather details, such as temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.
